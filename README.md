# React_Todo

This is a Todo React App which uses backend and database to Resgister and Login a user and also save a users Todos so that they can never lose their todo-list.
I have used node js for the Backend code. I used the express module for handling the requests and responses and i used the MYSQL Database for storing usernames and passwords and their particular Todos. I used the one to one relation between the todo table and the users table
